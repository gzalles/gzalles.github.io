							<h2>Some background</h2>
						</header>
						<p>My history as a musician started when I was just a young boy living in La Paz, Bolivia. I have always been a little bit different than other people. As a result, it was increasingly difficult to make any friends. Some of the more popular students in my class started a band and I became determined to be a part of it. For some reason rather than learning to play electric bass, the instrument they needed most at the time, I decided to pick up the guitar.</p>

						<p> I started taking classes with a <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/burnettbass?ref=br_rs"> local jazz musician</a> from La Paz and shortly after I was starting to play in a band of my own. I remember at that time I would learn how to play by bringing my teacher some pieces that I wanted to learn and he would find the tabs and show me how to play these riffs and chord progressions - I felt like the coolest person in world! </p>

						<p> Eventually I learned to fall in love with other aspects of music making. This was around the time that I moved to Bethesda, MD. My lifelong best friend lived in Annapolis and he introduced me to the wonders of electronic music production. We went to several festival together and immersed ourselves in the culture of Electronic Dance Music. Our passion was so great that we both decided to go to school to learn more about it. While he decided to make a carreer out of producing music I decided that the festival environment was generally not a good fit for me.</p>

						<p> Today I still produce music, mainly using Ableton, but I am also very intrigued with using algorithmic methods to create music. I did not discover this side of music making until I got to UCSD where I took an electronic music class with Miller Puckette, famed for creating Pure Data. Besides Pure Data I like to use CSound and Max to make music and am contemplating investing some time to learn RTCmix, Tone.JS and SuperCollider. </p>
