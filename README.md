my personal portfolio and resume

So I didnt really build anything. I just got a template and I modified some files. I found some apps that would potentially update my website automatically everytime I write an article, upload a video, etc, but I undid my work to some extent because I got greedy. 

Anyways, that has been the story of my site. I played with Jekyll for a while and started getting the hang of it but no, HTML it is. 

I figure it also gives me more control when writting web apps, if I ever get that far...

If there is anything about my site you like or not like or you have questions let me know. 

The rerouting of the URL was done via a Medium article that I found. 
https://medium.com/@hossainkhan/using-custom-domain-for-github-pages-86b303d3918a#:~:text=Go%20to%20your%20GitHub%20Pages,Don't%20delete%20it.

This is not the same article but it should get u there. I use GoDaddy because I think the name is funny. 

Cheers
