# hello-world

My name is Gabriel Zalles and I am a student. I have bene going to school to learn about Audio Engineering but I also like to code a lot. I am not very patient but I want coding to kind of help me become more patient as I feel is is a skill that demands it. I know most people will probably laugh when they read that last sentence and think: "Kid, you are in for world of hurt", but that is fine. I am conscious of the fact that for the things I want to do in life I will have to develop a sense of determination and perseverance, but that doesn't scare me. Not even failing does. I guess what truly scares me is that I will do something that I think is really, really amazing and no one will care. It's not a money thing. Or an ego thing. I just want to make something really, really awesome that will brighten up somebody's day, even for a minute.

I know that I am in a privileged position to be able to do this. "Code for fun". But it also brings me a great deal of peace and joy. I am not great at it, but I know I will get better with time because it is something that I really like doing. When I solve a problem, I get a sense of satisfaction that no one can take away from me. I guess that's my favorite part. I guess, subconsciously, I also get a depraved sense of joy from feeling smart. I want to work on that. I know I am not dumb, but I also know that I am in no way, shape, or form a brilliant guy, yet, or could ever be, without others' help.

I guess what I am trying to say is, I am glad I am here and I hope to make worthwhile contributions while I am alive.

Here's to hoping!
