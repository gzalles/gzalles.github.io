					<h2>Some background</h2>
				</header>
				<p>My history as a musician started when I was just a young boy living in La Paz, Bolivia. I have always been a little bit different than other people. As a result, it was increasingly difficult to make any friends. Some of the more popular students in my class started a band and I became determined to be a part of it. For some reason rather than learning to play electric bass, the instrument they needed most at the time, I decided to pick up the guitar.</p>

					<p> I started taking classes with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/burnettbass?ref=br_rs"> local jazz musician</a> from La Paz and shortly after I was starting to play in a band of my own. I remember at that time I would learn how to play by bringing my teacher some pieces that I wanted to learn and he would find the tabs and show me how to play these riffs and chord progressions - I felt like the coolest person in world! </p>

					<p> Today I still produce music, mainly using Ableton, but I am also very intrigued with using algorithmic methods to create music. I did not discover this side of music making until I got to UCSD where I took an electronic music class with Miller Puckette, famed for creating Pure Data. Besides Pure Data I like to use CSound and Max to make music and am contemplating investing some time to learn RTCmix, Tone.JS and SuperCollider. </p>

						<h2>Coming to Terms</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The summer after finishing my masters and before starting my PhD I had a lot of down time and I wanted to make music so I wrote this "LP" which consists of trap beats, electric guitars and jazzy chord progressions.</p>

								<h2>Origenes</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Origenes means origins in spanish. The title for this EP derived from a realization that I was losing my identity as a Bolivian citizen. I have been living in the United States for a long time and I want to assimilate very badly - fitting in has always been hard. This project was a reminder that there is a life I left behind. I wrote this EP as my final project at UCSD. All the songs in this EP are in spanish. I have a few others songs in English on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gabrielzalles">soundcloud</a>	page. </p>

							<p> This project was also an attempt to fuse spanish rock with traditional Bolivian instruments. In the process of making these songs I implemented some Kontakt libraries with pan flutes and charangos. I made all the songs alone, from beginning to end using Ableton. I think the hardest part was getting out of my shell as a singer and trying to be objective when mixing and mastering. The final presentation consisted of me singing these songs on an acoustic guitar in front of faculty and friends at UCSD.

									<p> Enjoy! ðŸŽ¼ </p>

									<p> Ps. The artwork was created by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ceci.bojanic"> Cecilia Bojanic </a>, a Bolivian graphic designer living in Argentina. The logo on the bottom left corner was the foundation proceeds were supposed to go to. We didn't make any money :/</p>

												<h2>Melancholic</h2>

											<p>Melancholic is an old EP I wrote while at UCSD around the year 2016. It's pop music with a lot of broody lyrics mostly talking about being sex. My friend Tasha Matthews from UCSD https://www.facebook.com/vc.tasha is featured on track 4.</p>
