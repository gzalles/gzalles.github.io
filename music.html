					<h2>Some background</h2>
				</header>
				<p>My history as a musician started when I was just a young boy living in La Paz, Bolivia. I have always been a little bit different than other people. As a result, it was increasingly difficult to make any friends. Some of the more popular students
					in my class started a band and I became determined to be a part of it. For some reason rather than learning to play electric bass, the instrument they needed most at the time, I decided to pick up the guitar.</p>

				<p> I started taking classes with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/burnettbass?ref=br_rs"> local jazz musician</a> from La Paz and shortly after I was starting to play in a band of my own. I remember at that time I would learn how to play by bringing my teacher some pieces that I wanted to learn and he would find the tabs and show me how to play these riffs and chord progressions - I felt like the coolest person in world! </p>

				<p> Eventually I learned to fall in love with other aspects of music making. This was around the time that I moved to Bethesda, MD. My lifelong best friend lived in Annapolis and he introduced me to the wonders of electronic music production. We went to several festival together and immersed ourselves in the culture of Electronic Dance Music. Our passion was so great that we both decided to go to school to learn more about it. While he decided to make a carreer out of producing music I decided that the festival environment was generally not a good fit for me.</p>

				<p> Today I still produce music, mainly using Ableton, but I am also very intrigued with using algorithmic methods to create music. I did not discover this side of music making until I got to UCSD where I took an electronic music class with Miller Puckette, famed for creating Pure Data. Besides Pure Data I like to use CSound and Max to make music and am contemplating investing some time to learn RTCmix, Tone.JS and SuperCollider. </p>

					<h2>Origenes</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Origenes means origins in spanish. The title for this EP derived from a realization that I was losing my identity as a Bolivian citizen. I have been living in the United States for a long time and I want to assimilate very badly - fitting in has always
					been hard. This project was a reminder that there is a life I left behind. I wrote this EP as my final project at UCSD. All the songs in this EP are in spanish. I have a few others songs on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gabrielzalles">soundcloud</a>					page. </p>

				<p> This project was als an attempt to fuse spanish rock with traditional Bolivian instruments. In the process of making these songs I implemented some Kontakt libraries with pan flutes and charangos. I made all the songs alone, from beginning to end
					using Ableton. I think the hardest part was getting out of my shell as a singer and trying to be objective when mixing and mastering. The final presentation consisted of me singing these songs on an acoustic guitar in front of faculty and friends
					at UCSD.
